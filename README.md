# Intro to R

## Course Description

Students, faculty, and staff in the health sciences, community health, and epidemiology will learn to use R, a statistical software frequently used in health sciences research. This course provides an overview on data entry, data management and manipulation, and visualization using R and also covers basic statistical applications, including linear regression, and logistic regression. To demonstrate proficiency, students will be given a dataset with steps to follow and analyze based on the learning outcomes. 

This class is expected to help students build capacity with R and the research process. They can begin to consider how to use R to apply their biostatistics knowledge to their graduate thesis or other research. 

## Learning outcomes

By the completion of this course, students will be expected to

1.	Be familiar with R windows/terminal.
2.	Enter/import data into R.  
3.	Manipulate R data and create new variables.
4.	Understand R data and procedures/steps. 
5.	Be able to correct common errors in R code.
6.	Use common procedures to analyze data.
7.	Successfully perform common procedures and analyze data of a given dataset
